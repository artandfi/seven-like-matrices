## Formulas for Determinant and Characteristic Polynomial of Seven-Like Matrices
The experiments conducted to verify the correctness of my algorithms for what I called seven-like matrices on certain data.

To see the definition of seven-like matrices and the derivation of the formulas, please refer to the following links:

## Original Motivation
Faster computation of Usher's model target values (see in Acknowledgements section below).

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my deepest gratitude
* to my family for their support and specifically to my father, Andriy Fisunenko, for suggesting improvements to my paper;
* to my academic supervisor, Vasyl Tereschenko, for his guidance throughout this research;
* and to assistant lecturer Tetiana Kolianova for giving me an inspiration for this paper through her academic assignment to find an optimal way of calculating the goal values of Usher's forest management model, and for providing me with literature from which I discovered Usher's paper (Usher, Michael B. "A matrix approach to the management of renewable resources, with special reference to selection forests." _Journal of Applied Ecology_ (1966): 355-367.).
